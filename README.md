   #          WETTO SHOP


Welcome to Wetto Shop, an e-commerce website that aims to provide a seamless shopping experience by allowing users to browse and purchase products from various categories. The project is developed using React front-end and it involves features such as product listing, filtering, shopping cart management, and user authentication. Below is an overview of the project structure and functionality.

## Functionality

Wetto shop includes the following functionality:

Product Listing: The Products component fetches product data from an API and displays it in a grid format. Users can view product images, titles, prices, ratings, and add products to the shopping cart. Products can be filtered by category using the filter buttons.

Shopping Cart: The Cart component displays the items added to the shopping cart. Users can remove items from the cart and clear the entire cart. The component also provides buttons to proceed to checkout.

Navigation: The Header component includes navigation links to different sections of the website, such as the homepage, about page, and the shopping cart.

User Authentication: The project includes user authentication features like login and sign-up. The SignUp component is an example of a sign-up form that can be used to create a new user account.

# Future plan

Checkout option
- We would like to provide an option for buyers to request shipping of the products to be delivered to their desired destinations.
